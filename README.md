# Week 1 Homework - Code Refactor

## Goal

The goal of this assignment was to take real-life example code and refactor it. The code that was given had several symantic issues and was very conjested. The code at the end had better clarity and description.

The beginning text was mainly full of div elements and had no section, header, or clear classes. I also removed some unused id tags, renamed classes, and conjoined classes. In addition, I also fixed the format of the style.css page and even removed some of the css and moved it to a new "reset.css" page.

One of the things that I changed was that I changed some of the elements to 'article' elements.  It was unclear after I Googled it and talked with the TA's if that was the right decision, if they should have been left as divs, or if I should have changed them to section elements.
